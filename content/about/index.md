HeyðŸ‘‹, I'm **Manjunath Mohan**, a **Software Engineer** based in Bengaluru, India, specializing in **Computer Vision and Deep Learning**. My interests extend to AI, Machine Learning, 3D Vision, Motion Capturing, Linux and FOSS.

This is my personal site where I share insights and how-tos, mostly centered around the tech/dev world, which continually piques my curiosity.

### **Experience**
My focus has primarily been on Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Software Development, contributing to areas such as Driver Monitoring, ADAS, and Surveillance Analytics. I hold a B.E. in Computer Science Engineering from Visvesvaraya Technological University, India.

### **Coding**
I'm passionate about coding, finding beauty in well-crafted code. While not every codebase ignites joy, finely crafted, well-engineered software certainly does. This drives my motivation â€“ well-crafted code. And a big believer in Code Review and Open Source

### **Tech**
Beyond my primary focus, I enjoy tinkering with various technologies creatively to understand how they work. I've been actively exploring the open source world and dipping into game mods and other exciting endeavors.

### **Approach**
When I'm able to contribute to making my team better, it brings me joy. I think it's important to share the things we've learned, offer feedback that can actually help, and be open to trying out new ideas.
