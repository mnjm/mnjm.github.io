I'm **Manjunath Mohan**, a **Software Engineer** based in Bengaluru, India, specializing in **Computer Vision and Deep Learning**. My interests extend to AI, Machine Learning, 3D Vision, Motion Capturing, Linux and FOSS.

This is my personal site where I share insights and how-tos, mostly centered around the tech/dev world, which continually piques my curiosity, thought I may/may not have posted anything yet :eyes:

## **Experience**
My focus has primarily been on Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Software Development, contributing to areas such as Driver Monitoring, and Surveillance Analytics. I hold a B.E. in Computer Science Engineering from Visvesvaraya Technological University, India.

## **Coding**
I'm passionate about coding, finding beauty in well-crafted code. While not every codebase ignites joy, finely crafted, well-engineered software certainly does. This drives my motivation â€“ well-crafted code. And a big believer in Code Review and Open Source

## **Tech**
Beyond my primary focus, I enjoy tinkering with various technologies creatively to understand how they work. I've been actively exploring the open source world and dipping into game mods and other exciting endeavors.
